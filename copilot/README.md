# Copilot prompts

Standalone prompts for **Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat**. Each file is one skill rewritten for a chat that can't read your repo, run commands or save files.

## How to use

1. Open the file and copy **everything below the `---` line**.
2. Paste it as the first message in a new Copilot Chat.
3. Paste or attach your source material, then follow the prompts.

Copilot works only from what you give it. Anything it would have saved comes back as markdown, with a suggested filename for you to save. Records that carry over between chats, such as handoffs, RAID logs, learner records and incident records, persist only if you paste them back in next time.

Long outputs arrive in numbered parts. Type **CONTINUE** to get the next one.

**Size.** Every prompt fits in one Copilot message. Two are over Agent Builder's 20,000-character skill limit: `review-ord` (23k) and `write-prd` (21k). The rest are under it.

## Typical chains

- **Planning:** idea → grill-me or grill-with-docs → research / prototype → write-prd → testplan → to-tickets → qa-plan → qa-report
- **Requirements review:** review-brd, review-ord
- **Session continuity:** handoff → (new chat) pickup · standup · update-context

## Full single-file skills

The requirements skills also ship whole, every file they cite included, as one generated file each. Attach these rather than pasting them, because they are large (roughly 140,000 to 230,000 characters). `write-prd` has both: the condensed prompt above for pasting, and the full skill here.

| File | Skill |
|---|---|
| `review-language-standalone.md` | Check a requirements document's wording against the language standard |
| `write-ac-standalone.md` | Acceptance criteria from a PRD and ORD |
| `write-brd-standalone.md` | Business Requirements Document |
| `write-ord-standalone.md` | Operational Requirements Document |
| `write-prd-standalone.md` | Product Requirements Document, full version |
| `write-reqs-standalone.md` | PRD and ORD together from one source |

## Not converted

These need a repo, terminal, git or the agent's own state, so they have no useful chat version.

| Skill | Why |
|---|---|
| approve | Archives files and seals the project log in the repo |
| backlog-list | Reads a backlog file; paste your backlog into add-backlog-item instead |
| build | Runs tickets and tests in the repo |
| check-pii | Scanning for personal information means pasting it into Copilot, which the data rules forbid |
| context-health, intent-layers | Measure an agent's context files |
| debrief, save-state | Covered by handoff (end-of-day and emergency-save cases) |
| feature-flag, tech-debt | Code-side registers that live in the repo |
| git-guardrails | Installs a git hook |
| graphify | Builds a code knowledge graph with tooling |
| grill-with-peer | Needs a second AI model in the loop |
| lang-rules, push-standards | Install rule files into the repo |
| learn | Records behaviour for the agent itself |
| resolve-findings | Updates a security report file; ask security-assessment to update a pasted report instead |
| rollback, update-dependencies | Run deployment or package commands |
| scan-first, test-coverage | Need the live source and a coverage tool |
| setup-brain | Scaffolds folders |
| tdd | Needs a test runner in the loop |
| token-report | Reads AI usage logs |
| write-a-skill | Writes and registers skill folders |

## Maintenance

These prompts are adapted by hand from the skills in [`skills/`](../skills), not generated from them, so a change to a skill reaches its prompt only when the prompt is updated too. `review-brd` and `review-ord` embed a fixed copy of the gate criteria from requirements pack v1.16.
