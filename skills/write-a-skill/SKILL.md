# Write a Skill

Create a new skill following the standard structure. Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/` (global) or `.claude/skills/` (project-level override).

> **Writing well** — this file covers *structure* (which files, what to update). For the
> *craft* of the prose inside them — **leading words**, checkable **completion criteria**,
> information hierarchy, and pruning out **no-ops** — read [CRAFT.md](CRAFT.md) before
> drafting a description or step. Predictability (same process every run) is the goal.
>
> **Names** — [RESERVED-NAMES.md](RESERVED-NAMES.md) holds the names Claude Code already claims,
> and step 2 below gates on it. A shadowed skill never loads and says nothing about why.

## Process

1. **Gather requirements** — ask the user:
   - What does this skill do?
   - What triggers it? (keywords, slash command, context)
   - Is it global (all projects) or project-specific?
   - Does it need supporting files (REFERENCE.md, EXAMPLES.md, scripts)?

2. **Check the name against [RESERVED-NAMES.md](RESERVED-NAMES.md)** — compare the proposed
   name to every Reserved row before anything is scaffolded. Report the result either way:
   "`<name>` is not on the reserved list (last verified YYYY-MM-DD)" is the pass, and it names
   the date so the author knows what the clearance is worth.

   **On a match, stop and gate.** Name the collision, quote the row's source and the stamp date,
   and offer two paths: a different name, or proceeding under the existing one. Proceeding
   requires the human to type `CONFIRM` — the list is stale by construction, so an author who
   knows the name has since been released may override it. Never scaffold through a match on
   your own judgement.

   Check the At Risk table too. A hit there is not a block — say so, and move on.

3. **Draft the skill** — create:
   - `SKILL.md` with concise instructions — target under 100 lines; if workflow logic exceeds this, extract supporting content (reference tables, templates, examples, scripts) to additional files (`REFERENCE.md`, `FORMATS.md`, `scripts/`, etc.)
   - Additional files for any content that would push `SKILL.md` over 100 lines or has a distinct domain
   - A command file if a `/user:skill-name` trigger is needed

4. **Review with user** — present the draft and ask:
   - Does this cover your use cases?
   - Anything missing or unclear?
   - Should any section be more or less detailed?

5. **Write the files** — once confirmed, create all files and make the updates in *After Writing Files* below.

## File Structure

```
~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/
  SKILL.md           ← required
  REFERENCE.md       ← if content exceeds 100 lines
  EXAMPLES.md        ← if examples would clutter SKILL.md

~/.claude/commands/[skill-name].md   ← if slash command needed
```

## SKILL.md Template

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
category: [pipeline|ideation|session|code-quality|knowledge|metrics|pi-release|sprint|maintenance|company|framework]
description: What this skill does. Use when [specific triggers].
---

# Skill Name

Brief description of what this skill does and when to use it.

## Process

1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Rules

- Rule one
- Rule two

## Output Format

[Describe what the skill produces]
```

## Description Requirements

The description is the primary signal the agent uses to select the right skill. Write it carefully:

- Max 1024 characters
- First sentence: what it does — front-load the skill's **leading word** (see [CRAFT.md](CRAFT.md))
- Second sentence: "Use when [specific triggers]" — one trigger per genuine branch; collapse synonyms that just rename the same branch
- Be specific — vague descriptions cause the wrong skill to be selected
- Prune harder than the body: a description is paid for on every turn, so cut any identity already stated in the skill body

**Good:**
```
Generate release notes from completed tickets, commit log, and decision records. Use when user runs /changelog, or a release is being prepared.
```

**Bad:**
```
Helps with releases.
```

## Command File Template

If the skill needs a `/user:skill-name` trigger, create `~/.claude/commands/[skill-name].md` containing plain text only — **not** a SKILL.md frontmatter file. The format is one short paragraph:

```
Invoke the [skill-name] skill. [What it does and what it produces.] [Key arguments or flags if any.] Use when [trigger conditions].
```

**Example** (`~/.claude/commands/handoff.md`):
```
Invoke the handoff skill. Compact the current session into a structured handoff for one stream of work, written to docs/handoffs/[stream].md and indexed in the register at docs/HANDOFF.md. References project artifacts by path rather than reproducing them. Suggests which skills the next session should use first. Optional arguments: the stream slug, and a description of what the next session will focus on (e.g. /handoff login-flow "next session: implement the login flow"). Add --archive to also save a timestamped copy, or --close to retire the stream.
```

The command file is what registers `/user:skill-name` in Claude Code. Without it, the skill exists but cannot be invoked as a slash command.

## After Writing Files

1. Confirm the files created/updated and their locations.
2. Remind the user: project-level skills go in `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md` and override global skills of the same name.

## When to Split Files

Split into separate files when:
- `SKILL.md` exceeds 100 lines — extract supporting content to `REFERENCE.md`, `FORMATS.md`, or other named files
- Content has distinct domains (e.g. workflow logic vs output templates vs scripts)
- Advanced reference material (reference tables, stub templates, config schemas) is rarely needed during normal use — keeping it out of `SKILL.md` keeps the workflow scannable

## Review Checklist

Before finalising, verify:
- [ ] Read [CRAFT.md](CRAFT.md) — description front-loads a **leading word**, every step has a **checkable completion criterion**, and the prose survives the **no-op test** (no line that changes nothing versus the agent's default)
- [ ] **Name checked against [RESERVED-NAMES.md](RESERVED-NAMES.md)** — no Reserved row matches, or a match was overridden by a typed `CONFIRM` and the reason recorded
- [ ] `category:` field set — valid values: `pipeline`, `ideation`, `session`, `code-quality`, `knowledge`, `metrics`, `pi-release`, `sprint`, `maintenance`, `company`, `framework`
- [ ] Description includes "Use when [triggers]"
- [ ] `SKILL.md` is under 100 lines — dense reference tables, stub templates, and rarely-needed config extracted to `REFERENCE.md` or additional named files
- [ ] No time-sensitive information included
- [ ] Command file created if slash command needed

## Failure Modes

When the skill you just wrote misbehaves, the cause is usually one of these. Full diagnosis and cures in [CRAFT.md](CRAFT.md#failure-modes-of-skill-prose).

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Agent stops a step before it's genuinely done | **Premature completion** — sharpen the step's completion criterion first; only split by sequence if it stays fuzzy in practice |
| Same instruction restated in two places, now drifting | **Duplication** — keep one authoritative copy, reference it from the other |
| Skill keeps growing; nobody dares delete | **Sediment** — run the relevance test on every edit and cut dead lines |
| Skill is too long though every line is live | **Sprawl** — disclose tier-3 reference behind context pointers in a sibling file |
| A line that changes nothing versus the agent's default | **No-op** — delete it, or replace a weak leading word with a stronger one |
| A "never" rule that's really steering intended behaviour | **Negation** — reframe as a positive leading word; keep "never" only for guardrails on consequential/irreversible actions |
| Skill was authored and never loads, with no error | **Shadowed name** — a vendor command won it. Check [RESERVED-NAMES.md](RESERVED-NAMES.md); a rename is a major version, and no stub or alias survives at the old name |
| Proposed name matches a Reserved row | Stop and gate — offer a rename, or a typed `CONFIRM` to proceed. Never decide it alone |
| Reserved list stamp is older than the staleness threshold | Say so at the point of the check, run the refresh procedure in [RESERVED-NAMES.md](RESERVED-NAMES.md), then check the name |
