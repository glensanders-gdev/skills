description: Planning phase grilling session that challenges a plan against the existing domain model, sharpens terminology, and updates CONTEXT.md and ADRs inline as decisions crystallise. The standard entry point for project planning in Forge. Use when stress-testing a plan against the project's language, codebase, and documented decisions.

# Grill With Docs

The planning phase entry point. Like `/grill-me` but domain-aware — challenges the plan against `docs/CONTEXT.md`, the codebase, and existing ADRs. Updates living documents inline as decisions are made.

See [FRONTIER.md](../grill-me/FRONTIER.md) for the traversal protocol — design tree, bounded rounds, question format, and stop condition. It is shared with `/grill-me` and is not restated here.
See [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](CONTEXT-FORMAT.md) for how to write and structure `CONTEXT.md`.
See [ADR-FORMAT.md](ADR-FORMAT.md) for when and how to write ADRs.

**Execution mode:** `[HITL]` throughout. Every round is a gate; the session cannot advance on the AI's own answers.

## Rules

- Work the design tree in **bounded frontier rounds** — up to 5 numbered questions per round, each carrying your recommended answer, then wait ([FRONTIER.md](../grill-me/FRONTIER.md)).
- **Facts you look up; decisions you put to the human.** Dispatch a subagent for codebase and environment facts rather than asking. A *decision* is theirs — put each one to them and wait; never decide on the human's behalf to keep the session moving.
- Never use a term that conflicts with `docs/CONTEXT.md` without flagging it first.

## Domain Awareness

Before beginning, explore the repo for:
- `docs/CONTEXT-MAP.md` — if it exists, read it to find all contexts and how they relate
- `docs/CONTEXT.md` — project domain glossary (single context)
- `docs/adr/` — existing architectural decisions
- `~/.claude/knowledge/systems/` — any relevant system overviews and known issues
- Existing code patterns relevant to the plan

If neither `CONTEXT-MAP.md` nor `CONTEXT.md` exists, create `docs/CONTEXT.md` lazily when the first term is resolved.

## During the Session

### Challenge Against the Glossary

When the user uses a term that conflicts with `docs/CONTEXT.md`, call it out immediately:
> "Your glossary defines 'X' as Y, but you seem to mean Z — which is it?"

### Sharpen Fuzzy Language

When the user uses vague or overloaded terms, propose a precise canonical term with an _Avoid_ alias:
> "You're saying 'account' — do you mean Customer or User? Those are different things in this codebase. I'll add 'account' as an alias to avoid."

### Cross-Reference With Code

When the user states how something works, check whether the code agrees. Surface contradictions:
> "Your code does X, but you just said Y — which is right?"

### Discuss Concrete Scenarios

Stress-test domain relationships with specific edge-case scenarios. Force precision about boundaries between related concepts.

## Updating CONTEXT.md Inline

When a term is resolved, update `docs/CONTEXT.md` immediately — never batch updates.

Follow [CONTEXT-FORMAT.md](CONTEXT-FORMAT.md). Key points:

- One sentence definition — what it IS, not what it does
- Include `_Avoid_` aliases for rejected synonyms
- Add to "Flagged Ambiguities" if a term was used inconsistently
- Write or update "Example Dialogue" when enough terms exist to show natural usage
- Only include domain-specific terms — not general programming concepts

```markdown
**[Term]**:
[Plain language definition. One sentence.]
_Avoid_: [synonym1, synonym2]
```

For multi-context repos, infer which `CONTEXT.md` to update based on the topic. Ask if unclear.

---

## Offering ADRs

Only offer an ADR when ALL THREE are true (see [ADR-FORMAT.md](ADR-FORMAT.md)):

1. **Hard to reverse** — changing this later has meaningful cost
2. **Surprising without context** — a future reader would wonder "why?"
3. **A real trade-off** — there were genuine alternatives and one was chosen for specific reasons

ADR filename format: `docs/adr/NNNN-[slug].md`

Keep ADRs minimal — the template is a title and 1-3 sentences. Add optional sections only when they add genuine value:

```markdown
# [Short title of the decision]

[1-3 sentences: what's the context, what did we decide, and why.]
```

Reference the ADR filename in the session's DEVLOG "Decisions Made" entry.

---

## After Session

When the frontier is empty, produce a Shared Understanding Summary:

```markdown
## Shared Understanding — [Feature/Plan Name]

### Decisions Made
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

### CONTEXT.md Updates
- Added: [Term] — [definition]
- Flagged: [ambiguity and resolution]

### ADRs Written
- [NNNN-slug.md] — [one sentence summary]

### Open Questions (if any)
- [Anything unresolved]

### Recommended Next Stage
Research | Prototype | /write-prd
```

Suggest next stage and wait for human confirmation before proceeding.

## Failure Modes

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Neither `CONTEXT-MAP.md` nor `CONTEXT.md` exists | Create `docs/CONTEXT.md` lazily when the first term resolves — don't block the session on it. |
| A question is answerable from the codebase | Dispatch a subagent to answer it rather than asking the user — and ask the rest of the round now instead of blocking on the subagent. |
| Round presented with no closing prompt | The human cannot tell a gate from a report and the session stalls. Close it: name **change / discuss / accept**, and say how many questions are held back. |
| Frontier is wider than 5 questions | Ask the highest-leverage subset and state how many are held back and what they cover — never dump the whole frontier, never truncate silently. |
| User answers some questions in a round but not others | The unanswered ones stay on the frontier and go into the next round — never read silence as agreement with your recommendation. |
| User's term conflicts with the glossary | Flag the conflict immediately — never silently adopt a clashing term. |
| Decision is hard to reverse, surprising, and a real trade-off | Offer an ADR; if not all three hold, don't write one. |
| Tempted to batch CONTEXT.md updates | Update inline the moment a term resolves — never batch. |
| Open questions remain at session end | Record them in the Shared Understanding Summary — don't force a premature next stage. |
