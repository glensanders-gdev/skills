# Backlog List

Display the global backlog from `~/.claude/backlog.md`, grouped by priority. This is the framework-level backlog — for project-level backlogs use `/user:backlog-proj`.

## Process

1. Read `~/.claude/backlog.md`.
2. Group items by priority: P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → Unranked.
3. Within each group, maintain date-added order.
4. Display the formatted list.
5. Offer: "Want to add an item? Run `/user:add-backlog-item`."

## Output Format

```markdown
## Global Backlog

### P1 — Critical
- [item] — [why it matters] · Added YYYY-MM-DD

### P2 — High
- [item] — [why it matters] · Added YYYY-MM-DD

### P3 — Normal
- [item] — [why it matters] · Added YYYY-MM-DD

### P4 — Low
- [item] — [why it matters] · Added YYYY-MM-DD

### Unranked
- [item] — [why it matters] · Added YYYY-MM-DD

**Total:** N items (N unranked)
```

## Failure Modes

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| `backlog.md` missing | "No global backlog found. Run `/user:add-backlog-item` to create one." |
| Backlog is empty | "Global backlog is empty." Offer `/user:add-backlog-item`. |
| Items have no priority | Group under Unranked. Offer to run `/user:add-backlog-item` to triage them. |

## Rules

- This is a read-only display — never modify `backlog.md`; adding items is `/add-backlog-item`.
- Preserve priority grouping and date-added order within groups — never reorder by inference.
