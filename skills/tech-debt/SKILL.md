description: Track and manage technical debt in the current project. Add entries with priority and location, list by priority, and resolve items when addressed. Sprint planning surfaces High items as candidates. Per-project register at docs/tech-debt.md. Use when user runs /tech-debt or identifies debt during a session.

# Tech Debt

Per-project technical debt register. Separate from the backlog — debt has a priority tier
that reflects accumulated interest and surfaces automatically at sprint planning.

---

## Usage

```
/tech-debt add                     ← capture a new debt item
/tech-debt list                    ← show all items, grouped by priority
/tech-debt list --high             ← show High priority only
/tech-debt resolve TD-NNN          ← mark an item as resolved
/tech-debt review                  ← re-prioritise all open items
```

---

## Register Format

`docs/tech-debt.md`:

```markdown
# Tech Debt Register — [Project Name]

## Priority Tiers

- **High** — actively slowing current work right now
- **Medium** — will become High within 2–3 sprints if unaddressed
- **Low** — acknowledged, not blocking

---

## Open

| ID | Description | Priority | Location | Added | Notes |
|----|-------------|----------|----------|-------|-------|
| TD-001 | ORM queries not using eager loading — N+1 on every list view | High | src/db/queries.ts | 2026-05-24 | Impacts all paginated endpoints |

## Resolved

| ID | Description | Priority | Resolved | How |
|----|-------------|----------|---------|-----|
```

---

## `/tech-debt add`

Ask in sequence:

1. **Description** — what is the debt? Be specific about the code concern.
2. **Location** — file path or module (e.g. `src/auth/session.ts`, `all API handlers`)
3. **Priority** — High / Medium / Low. Present the definitions:
   ```
   High   — actively slowing current work right now
   Medium — will become High within 2–3 sprints
   Low    — acknowledged, not blocking
   ```
4. **Notes** — optional context, links, or impact description

Assign the next TD-NNN ID. Show the entry for confirmation before writing:

```
Ready to add:

  TD-004 | Missing database indexes on user lookups | High
  Location: src/db/schema.ts
  Notes: Every search query does a full table scan — visible in staging load tests

Add to docs/tech-debt.md? (yes/no)
```

If confirmed, append to the Open table.

---

## `/tech-debt list`

Display all open items grouped by priority:

```
## Tech Debt — [Project Name]

### 🔴 High (N items)
TD-001 | ORM N+1 on list views | src/db/queries.ts | Added 2026-05-01
TD-004 | Missing DB indexes on user lookups | src/db/schema.ts | Added 2026-05-24

### 🟡 Medium (N items)
TD-002 | Auth middleware duplicated across 3 routes | src/middleware/ | Added 2026-04-15

### 🔵 Low (N items)
TD-003 | Deprecated crypto algorithm in token signing | src/auth/tokens.ts | Added 2026-03-10

Resolved: N items (run /tech-debt list --resolved to view)
```

---

## `/tech-debt resolve TD-NNN`

Ask:
> "How was TD-NNN resolved? (brief note for the record)"

Move the entry from Open to Resolved, recording the date and fix note.

```
✅ TD-NNN marked resolved.

   Description: [original description]
   Resolved: YYYY-MM-DD
   How: [note]
```

---

## `/tech-debt review`

Present all open items and ask for a priority re-assessment on each:

```
Reviewing open tech debt for [Project Name].

TD-001 | ORM N+1 on list views | Currently: High
New priority? (High / Medium / Low / unchanged)
```

Work through each item. Update any changed priorities. Show a summary at the end:
```
Review complete. Changes: N items re-prioritised.
  TD-002: Medium → High (escalated)
  TD-003: Low → resolved (fixed in sprint)
```

---

## Failure Modes

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| `docs/tech-debt.md` missing | Create it with the standard header on first `/tech-debt add` |
| ID not found for resolve | List open IDs and ask to confirm |
| No High items | Note "No High priority tech debt" in start-sprint — do not warn |
| Empty register | Note "No tech debt registered" on list |

---

## Rules

- Priority definitions are fixed — never invent new tiers
- Descriptions must be specific enough to be actionable: file path or module required
- Never auto-add items — always confirm before writing
- Resolved items are retained in the register for historical reference
