description: Capture and stress-test a new idea through structured grilling — problem statement, baseline measurements, destination targets, journey, impact vs effort, and assumptions. Produces idea.md and living Mermaid diagrams. Use when user runs /idea, pitches an idea formally, or uses informal idea language like "I've been thinking about..." or "what if we...".

# Idea

Capture a raw idea and stress-test it into a well-framed problem worth solving. Produces a structured `idea.md` and living sequence diagrams that evolve through the project lifecycle.

## Trigger Detection

If the user has NOT run `/user:idea` explicitly but uses informal idea language ("I've been thinking about...", "what if we...", "it would be great if...", "wouldn't it be good to..."), ask once:

> "That sounds like an idea worth capturing — want me to run `/idea` on it?"

If yes, proceed. If no, continue normally.

---

## Process

### 1. Capture the Pitch

Before anything else, assign an IDEA ID:
1. Read `~/.claude/registry.md` — get the next IDEA number
2. Increment the counter and update the registry
3. Note the ID for use throughout the session: e.g. `IDEA-003`

Ask the user to describe the idea in their own words. No structure yet — just let them pitch it. Listen for:
- What problem it solves
- Who has the problem
- What they think the solution might look like

### 2. Grill — One Question at a Time

Work through each area below, one question at a time. Provide a recommended answer or suggested measurement for each. Challenge vague answers.

#### Problem Statement
- What is the specific problem today?
- Who experiences it?
- What is the cost or impact of the problem not being solved?
- Challenge: "Is this actually a problem, or a preference?"

#### Baseline Measurements
- How is the problem currently measured (or how could it be)?
- What are the current numbers?
- Suggest additional metrics the user may not have considered based on the problem domain
- Challenge: "Is this metric actually observable? How would you get this data today?"
- Flag any unvalidated baselines as assumptions

#### Destination Targets
- What does success look like, in measurable terms?
- What specific number or state are we aiming for?
- By when?
- Challenge: "Is this target realistic? What's the evidence?"
- Flag any targets based on assumptions

#### Journey
- How do we get from baseline to destination?
- What are the major steps or interventions?
- What systems or people are involved?
- What dependencies or blockers exist?
- Challenge: "Is this the only way? What could go wrong?"

#### Impact vs Effort
After the four areas above, estimate:
- **Impact:** High / Medium / Low — how significant is the outcome if successful?
- **Effort:** High / Medium / Low — how much work to get there?
- Present as a 2x2 and ask the user to confirm

```
         LOW EFFORT    HIGH EFFORT
HIGH IMPACT  ★ Pursue now   → Plan carefully
LOW IMPACT   → Consider     ✗ Probably skip
```

#### Assumptions to Validate
List every assumption made during the grill:
- Baseline data not yet confirmed
- Targets based on estimates
- Journey steps that depend on unknowns
- Each assumption tagged: Unvalidated / Confirmed / Invalidated

### 3. Draft Journey Diagram (Mid-Grill)

After the Journey section is explored — before the grill is complete — produce a draft Mermaid sequence diagram to represent understanding so far. Present it inline.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Problem as Current State
    participant Intervention as Proposed Solution
    participant Outcome as Target State
    Problem->>Intervention: [trigger or step]
    Intervention->>Outcome: [result]
```

Ask: "Does this represent the idea correctly? What's missing or wrong?"

Update based on feedback before continuing.

### 4. Complete the Grill

Return to any remaining questions. Once all four areas plus assumptions are captured, produce the **Idea Summary** for confirmation.

### 5. System Interaction Diagram

After the grill is complete, produce a second Mermaid diagram showing system interactions — what talks to what in the proposed solution.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant [System A]
    participant [System B]
    User->>[System A]: [action]
    [System A]->>[System B]: [data or call]
    [System B]-->>[System A]: [response]
    [System A]-->>User: [outcome]
```

### 5.5 — Feature-Level Estimate

After the grill is complete and before the decision gate, generate a feature-level estimate:

1. Based on the problem statement, journey, and proposed approach, estimate:
   - **AI Token Cost band** — how much AI execution will this feature require to build?
   - **Story Points** — how complex and uncertain is this relative to other work?

2. Present as a table for human confirmation:

```
## Feature Estimate — [Idea Name]

| Metric | Estimate | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| AI Token Cost | S/M/L/XL | [one sentence] |
| Story Points | 1/2/3/5/8/13 | [one sentence] |

⚠️ XL flag: [none / this feature requires /break-down before /build]

Confirm these estimates or adjust before proceeding to the decision gate.
```

3. On confirmation, add to `idea.md`:

```markdown
## Estimates
**AI Token Cost:** [band] ([range])
**Story Points:** [N]pts
**Last estimated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Current
```

4. If XL — note explicitly: "This feature will require `/break-down` before `/build` can execute it."

### 6. Decision Gate

Present the completed idea summary and ask:

```
This idea is ready for a decision.

Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
Effort: [High/Medium/Low]

Type ACCEPT, DECLINE, or HOLD.
```

**ACCEPT** → move to `~/.claude/ideas/active/[idea-name]/`, suggest `/user:create-project`; if a project RAID log exists (`docs/raid/`), ask: "Log this decision in the RAID log? (yes/no)" — if yes, run `/raid add decision` pre-populated with the idea name and `IDEA-NNN` in Source.
**DECLINE** → ask for reason, archive to `~/.claude/ideas/archived/[idea-name]/`
**HOLD** → save to `~/.claude/ideas/active/[idea-name]/` with status `Holding`

### 7. Save Files

Save to the appropriate folder:

- `idea.md` — full structured document (with IDEA-NNN in header)
- `diagram.mmd` — current diagram (always latest)
- `diagram-v1-idea.mmd` — baseline snapshot at idea stage

Update `~/.claude/registry.md` Idea Registry table:
```markdown
| IDEA-NNN | [Idea Name] | Active/Holding/Declined | — | ~/.claude/ideas/[active|archived]/[idea-name]/ |
```

---

## idea.md Template

```markdown
# Idea: [Idea Name]

**ID:** IDEA-NNN
**Status:** Active | Holding | Declined
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Impact:** High | Medium | Low
**Effort:** High | Medium | Low
**Project:** PROJ-NNN | None

## Diagram Update Points

At each pipeline stage, update `diagram.mmd` and save a versioned snapshot:

| Idea capture | End of `/idea` | `diagram-v1-idea.mmd` |
| Design | End of `/grill-me` | `diagram-v2-design.mmd` |
| PRD | End of `/write-prd` | `diagram-v3-prd.mmd` |
| Final | `/approve` | `diagram-v4-final.mmd` |

## Rules

- Ask one question at a time during the grill
- Challenge unmeasurable baselines and vague targets before accepting them
- Suggest additional metrics — present as options, not requirements
- Draft journey diagram must be produced mid-grill, before grill is complete
- Never save files until the decision gate is reached
- Declined ideas are never deleted — always archived with a reason
- HOLD is a valid outcome — not every idea needs an immediate decision
- Always generate a feature-level estimate before the decision gate — never skip it
- XL estimates must be flagged immediately with a `/break-down` requirement note

## Failure Modes

| Condition | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| User uses informal idea language without running `/idea` | Ask once whether to capture it; proceed only on yes. |
| `~/.claude/registry.md` missing | Create it and start IDEA numbering from IDEA-001 before grilling. |
| Baseline or target is unmeasurable | Challenge it; if it stays vague, tag it as an Unvalidated assumption rather than accepting it. |
| Feature estimates XL | Flag the `/break-down` requirement immediately at the estimate step. |
| User wants to save mid-grill | Don't — files are written only at the decision gate. |
| Decision is DECLINE | Archive with a reason — never delete a declined idea. |
