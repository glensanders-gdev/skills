# Intent Layers

Alias for `/context-health`. Invoke the context-health skill directly.

Intent Layer is Tyler Brandt's term for directory-scoped `AGENTS.md` files that give the AI agent
scoped instructions without loading the entire project context. `/context-health` includes Intent
Layer child node recommendations as of v1.1.0.

## Failure Modes

- If `/context-health` is not available, report it clearly — do not guess.

## Rules

- Always delegate to `/context-health` — do not reimplement logic here.
