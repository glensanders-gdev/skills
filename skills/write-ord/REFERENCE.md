# write-ord Reference

ISO/IEC 25010:2023 taxonomy and ORD template used by SKILL.md, plus the **ISO/IEC 25059:2023**
sub-characteristics that extend it where a delivered component's behaviour is learned or generated
rather than specified.

---

## ISO/IEC 25010:2023 Quality Characteristics

Nine top-level characteristics. Map every non-functional requirement to one sub-characteristic before writing the ORD.

### 1. Functional Suitability
Does the system do the right things?
- **Functional Completeness** — all specified tasks covered
- **Functional Correctness** — accurate results with required precision
- **Functional Appropriateness** — functions align with user goals

*ORD relevance:* operational scope, what the system must do in production (not how it is built).

### 2. Performance Efficiency
Does the system perform its functions within required time, throughput, and resource constraints?
- **Time Behavior** — response and processing times, throughput rates *(highest ORD priority)*
- **Resource Utilization** — CPU, memory, storage, network, energy usage
- **Capacity** — maximum concurrent users, peak transaction volumes, data volume limits

*ORD relevance:* quantified thresholds required. "Fast" is not a requirement.

### 3. Compatibility
Can the system exchange information and coexist with other systems?
- **Coexistence** — operates without harming other systems sharing the environment
- **Interoperability** — exchanges information with specified external systems per defined protocols

*ORD relevance:* interface table, protocol standards, failure behavior on integration errors.

### 4. Interaction Capability *(formerly Usability — 2011)*
Can specified users operate the system to achieve their goals?
- **Appropriateness Recognizability** — users can identify if the system fits their needs
- **Learnability** — users can learn to operate it within a specified timeframe
- **Operability** — easy to operate and control
- **User Engagement** — features encourage continued use *(replaced UI Aesthetics)*
- **Accessibility** — usable by people with the widest range of characteristics
- **Inclusivity** — designed for diverse abilities and backgrounds *(NEW in 2023)*
- **Self-Descriptiveness** — system communicates how to use it correctly *(NEW in 2023)*

*ORD relevance:* operator training requirements, accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA), self-service capability.

### 5. Reliability
Does the system perform its functions without failure over a specified period under specified conditions?
- **Faultlessness** — degree to which the system is free from faults *(replaced Maturity — 2023)*
- **Availability** — system is operational and accessible when required
- **Fault Tolerance** — maintains operation despite hardware or software faults
- **Recoverability** — restores data and operations following interruption or failure

*ORD relevance:* uptime targets, MTBF, MTTR, RTO, RPO, degraded-mode requirements. KPP candidates live here.

### 6. Security
Does the system protect information and data with appropriate access controls?
- **Confidentiality** — data accessible only to authorized parties
- **Integrity** — state and data protected from unauthorized modification or deletion
- **Non-repudiation** — actions can be proven to have taken place
- **Accountability** — actions traceable to the entity that performed them
- **Authenticity** — identity of subjects and resources can be verified
- **Resistance** — system sustains operations under attack *(NEW in 2023)*

*ORD relevance:* compliance frameworks (FedRAMP, HIPAA, ISO 27001, PCI-DSS), encryption standards, penetration test thresholds, access control model.

### 7. Maintainability
Can the system be effectively and efficiently modified without degrading quality?
- **Modularity** — change to one component has minimal impact on others
- **Reusability** — components can be used across products or contexts
- **Analyzability** — impact of intended changes can be assessed
- **Modifiability** — changes can be made without introducing defects

*ORD relevance:* patch management cadence, configuration management, change window requirements, version control obligations.

### 8. Flexibility *(formerly Portability — 2011)*
Can the system operate effectively in contexts not originally specified?
- **Adaptability** — adapts to different or evolving hardware, software, and usage environments
- **Installability** — can be successfully installed/uninstalled in specified environments
- **Replaceability** — can replace another specified product for the same purpose
- **Scalability** — handles growing or shrinking workloads; elastic capacity *(NEW in 2023)*

*ORD relevance:* cloud hosting model, elasticity requirements, multi-region or multi-tenancy, upgrade and rollback procedures.

### 9. Safety *(NEW top-level characteristic — 2023)*
Does the system protect against risk of injury or harm to people, property, or the environment?
- **Operational Constraint** — operational constraints prevent hazardous situations
- **Risk Identification** — hazardous situations and conditions are identified
- **Fail Safe** — system reaches a safe state on failure
- **Hazard Warning** — timely, effective warnings about hazards are provided
- **Safe Integration** — safe integration with other systems

*ORD relevance:* applicable to safety-critical systems (healthcare, infrastructure, industrial control). If not applicable, note explicitly.

## ISO/IEC 25059:2023 — AI Extension *(conditional)*

**Applies only where the trigger test in `~/.claude/rules/requirements/ai.md` fires** — a delivered
component whose output for a given input is not fully determined by written logic. 25059 sits inside
the same SQuaRE series as 25010 and **extends it**: it adds the sub-characteristics below and
inherits everything above unchanged. It is not a replacement taxonomy and does not restructure §3.

| Added sub-characteristic | Extends | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| **Functional Adaptability** | 1. Functional Suitability | Behaviour holding as data, context or usage shifts from what the component was tuned on |
| **Robustness** | 5. Reliability | Behaviour under out-of-distribution, adversarial or malformed input |
| **User Controllability** | 6. Interaction Capability | The operator's ability to direct, constrain or halt the component |
| **Intervenability** | 6. Interaction Capability | A named human's authority to override an output, and the point at which they can |
| **Transparency** | 6. Interaction Capability | Output labelling, explanation of a decision, disclosure that a component is AI |

*ORD relevance:* every one of these needs a threshold on a named held-out `EVL-NNN` evaluation set,
a floor, and a review hook — see `rules/requirements/ai.md` § *The evaluative criterion*. Accuracy
and fairness are **not** new sub-characteristics: they are Functional Correctness measured the AI
way, which is why they sit under §3.8 in the template below rather than here.

**Watch item (ADR-0003):** the 25059 second edition awaits member-body vote. Its AI *service*
quality model — traceability, service adaptability, customizability — is the part most relevant to
AI consumed as a service. Re-check before treating this patch as stable.

## 3. Operational Performance Parameters

> Requirements in this section are organized by ISO/IEC 25010:2023 characteristics.  
> **[KPP]** = Key Performance Parameter — failure constitutes program/system failure.  
> **[AI]** = governed by `rules/requirements/ai.md` — learned or generated behaviour. Both, in this
> order: **[KPP][AI]**.  
> Wording follows `rules/requirements/language.md`; presentation, schemas and IDs follow
> `rules/requirements/tables.md`. Both are authoritative — the tables below show the shape only.

Every requirement is one row in the register schema below. The subsection heading supplies the
25010 characteristic, so no characteristic column is needed.

**Worked example** — the threshold lives *inside* the Requirement Description as a declarative
end state, never in a separate column:

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BRD-04 | ORD-001 | Search results are returned within 3 seconds at P95 under normal load | Must | Q3 FY26 | Digital, Service Ops, A. Patel | Platform Engineering | APM tool, monthly report | CAP-12 | EPIC-31 | Threshold agreed at 12 Jun workshop |

| Column | Holds |
|---|---|
| `BRD#` | Originating BRD item — `BO-N` for an objective, `BR-N` for a business requirement, which are the IDs `/write-brd` emits. Never `BRD-NN`; nothing produces that form. `—` where no BRD exists — then `Source` carries provenance alone. |
| `ORD#` | `ORD-NNN`, flat and sequential, never reused. |
| `Requirement Description` | The declarative end state, carrying its own quantified value. Prefix **[KPP]** where failure constitutes program failure, and **[AI]** where `rules/requirements/ai.md` governs the row — **[KPP][AI]** where both. An `[AI]` row names an `EVL-NNN` set; one that does not is incomplete. |
| `MoSCoW` | `Must` / `Should` / `Could` / `Won't`. |
| `Timing` | When the requirement needs to be live — release, quarter, or date. |
| `Source` | Business Unit, Function, Name. |
| `Delivery Agent` | The department accountable for delivering it. |
| `Verification` | How it is proven — load test, monitoring tool, audit, DR drill. Required; `/write-ac` rejects an operational criterion without one. |
| `Capability` | The Jira Capability whose AC covers it. Written back by `/write-ac`. |
| `Epic` | The Epic under that Capability delivering it. Written back by `/write-ac`. |
| `Comments` | Free text during refinement. Never the home of a commitment — if it binds, it belongs in the Description. |

**MoSCoW and [KPP] are orthogonal and both are kept.** A KPP is a program-failure threshold; a
Must is required for this release. Most KPPs are Musts; most Musts are not KPPs.

**[AI] is orthogonal to both.** It records which ruleset governs the row's *form* — not its priority
and not its severity. An `[AI]` row carries a MoSCoW value like any other.

**`Should` and `Could` as MoSCoW values do not violate `language.md`.** That rule bans hedging
verbs inside requirement *text*. A controlled enum in a priority column is unambiguous.

Where source material gives no value, write the Description as `[TBD — source: "quoted vague
statement"]` — never drop to prose, and never invent a value.

**Subsections with no requirement are omitted from the body** and listed once in the Coverage
Gaps table at the end of this section. Check against the full sub-characteristic set in the
taxonomy above — all nine characteristics and every sub-characteristic — not only the
subsections pre-scaffolded below.

**Subsections marked *(AI — 25059)* below are conditional.** They are live only where the trigger
test in `rules/requirements/ai.md` fires; where it does not, they are not requirements with no
source material but subsections that do not apply — omit them from the body *and* from the §3.10
Coverage Gaps table, and state once in §3.10 that the AI trigger did not fire. Where it does fire,
every one of them is checked, and each requirement written under them carries a threshold on a
named `EVL-NNN` set, a floor, and a review hook per that ruleset.

---

**3.2.5 Robustness** *(AI — 25059)* — behaviour under out-of-distribution, adversarial or malformed

---

**3.3.7 Prompt Injection and Model Attack Surface** *(AI — 25059, AI Act Art. 15)* — resistance to
instruction injection carried in retrieved content, user input or tool output; the trust boundary
between instructions and data; model extraction and training-data exfiltration. Name the actor and
use the active voice where authorisation is load-bearing.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |

---

### 3.4 Compatibility

**3.4.1 Interoperability** — one register row per interface, as normal. Per-interface technical
detail lives in Appendix E, keyed by `ORD#`, so the register keeps one schema throughout.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [e.g. Consignment status is exchanged with [System] over HTTPS, queued on failure] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [e.g. integration test] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | see Appendix E |

---

**3.6.3 Record-Keeping and Inference Logging** *(AI — AI Act Art. 12)* — what is retained per
inference (input, output, model version, confidence, the `MDL-NNN` in force), for how long, and who
can read it. Retention is a commitment with a number, not a note in the support model.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |

---

**3.7.4 User Controllability and Intervenability** *(AI — 25059, AI Act Art. 14)* — how an operator
directs, constrains or halts the component, and **which named role** holds authority to override an
output, at what point, on what evidence. Name the actor and use the active voice — "oversight is
provided" names nobody and binds nobody.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

**3.7.5 Transparency and Explainability** *(AI — 25059, AI Act Arts. 13, 50)* — disclosure that an
output is AI-generated, output labelling, and what explanation accompanies a decision. "The model is
explainable" is an unquantified adjective; state what is shown, to whom, and when.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

### 3.8 Functional Suitability

**3.8.1 Functional Completeness** — operational functions required at go-live; what can be phased.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

---

**3.8.2 Functional Adaptability** *(AI — 25059)* — behaviour holding as data, context or usage
shift away from what the component was tuned on. Carries the drift measure and its band (for example
a population-stability index threshold), the re-verification cadence, and the runbook each drift
alert names. "Drift is monitored" is not a requirement.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

**3.8.3 Accuracy and Fairness Thresholds** *(AI — 25059, AI Act Art. 15)* — Functional Correctness
measured the AI way. Every threshold names the held-out `EVL-NNN` set it is measured on, carries a
floor as well as a mean, and states what happens to a case below threshold. A mean with no floor
hides the case that harms someone; a threshold measured on data the component was tuned against is
not a threshold.

### 3.9 Safety *(if applicable)*

**3.9.1 Fail Safe** — safe-state definition and behaviour on failure.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

**3.9.2 Hazard Warning** — alerting for hazardous conditions.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

**3.9.3 Prohibited Outputs** *(AI — 25059, AI Act Art. 15)* — an output unacceptable **at any rate**,
stated with a tolerance of zero and its own verification method. This is not a floor on a scored
scale: scoring such an output at all implies a rate at which it passes. Each row here is referenced
by the `Prohibited outputs` column of the `EVL-NNN` set scored alongside it, and restates no value
from it. Where the prohibited output is a disclosure rather than a hazard — a leaked secret, a
protected-attribute inference — the row belongs in §3.3 Security instead; put it in one place, not
both.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

> If Safety is not applicable, state in place of the tables above: "[System name] is not
> classified as safety-critical. Safety characteristic requirements are not applicable."

### 3.10 Coverage Gaps

Every ISO/IEC 25010:2023 sub-characteristic with no requirement, listed once. Subsections with no
requirement do not appear in the body above — they appear here.

| Absent subsection | Reason | Action |
|---|---|---|
| [e.g. 3.5 Flexibility → Replaceability] | [e.g. no source material] | [e.g. stakeholder workshop] |

A requirement that exists but is unquantified is **not** a gap — it stays in its own table as a
`[TBD — source: "…"]` row.

## 4. Operating Environment and Constraints

Environment and regulatory statements are binding, so they are requirements and carry IDs. Prose
belongs in §2.2 System Overview, not here.

### 4.1 Physical Environment
Hosting model, geographic locations, data residency, power and cooling.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

### 4.2 Network and Connectivity
Bandwidth, latency bounds, protocol and connectivity constraints.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

> Network latency that affects user-facing response time belongs in §3.1.1 Time Behavior. Record
> it once — cite the ID here as a view rather than restating the value.

### 4.3 Regulatory and Compliance Constraints
Each regulation and the specific operational obligation it imposes.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

> Certification and audit obligations belong in §3.3.6 Compliance Frameworks. This subsection
> carries operational obligations imposed *by* regulation, not the frameworks themselves.

## 5. Support Model

### 5.1 Support Tier Structure
| Tier | Description | Owner | Coverage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | Self-service / knowledge base | [Team] | 24/7 |
| Tier 1 | Service desk — first contact | [Team] | [Hours] |
| Tier 2 | Technical operations | [Team] | [Hours / On-call] |
| Tier 3 | Development / vendor escalation | [Team / Vendor] | [SLA-driven] |

### 5.2 Incident Management

Severity definitions are context (prose); the response and resolution commitments are register rows.

| Severity | Definition |
|---|---|
| P1 Critical | [definition] |
| P2 High | [definition] |
| P3 Medium | [definition] |
| P4 Low | [definition] |

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [e.g. P1 incident response is initiated within 15 minutes of raise] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [e.g. ITSM report] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [e.g. P1 incident resolution is achieved within 2 hours of raise] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [e.g. ITSM report] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

### 5.3 Change and Patch Management
Change windows, emergency change path, patch SLAs by severity.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

### 5.4 Monitoring and Alerting
Instrumentation coverage, alert thresholds, on-call routing.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

## 6. Staffing and Organizational Requirements

Role roster — context, not commitments. The binding staffing requirements are register rows below.

| Role | Responsibilities | Skills / Certifications | FTE |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Role] | [Description] | [Requirements] | [Count] |

**Operating commitments** — on-call, training, handover, and the FTE establishment itself are
binding, so they are rows.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

---

## 7. Service Level Requirements

> *View of Sections 3 and 5. Values are authoritative in the referenced rows; this table adds no
> new commitments.* Externally-facing SLA summary — every row cites an existing `ORD-NNN`.

| ORD# | Section | Metric | Agreed value | Measurement Period | Data Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ORD-NNN | §3.2.1 | Availability | [as registered] | Calendar month | [Monitoring tool] |
| ORD-NNN | §5.2 | P1 Response | [as registered] | Per incident | [ITSM tool] |
| ORD-NNN | §3.2.4 | MTTR | [as registered] | Rolling 3 months | [ITSM tool] |

**SLA governance** — review cadence and breach reporting are themselves commitments.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

---

## 8. Infrastructure and Facilities

Hosting model, compute, storage, network, and physical security of operational infrastructure.

| BRD# | ORD# | Requirement Description | MoSCoW | Timing | Source | Delivery Agent | Verification | Capability | Epic | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [BO-N / BR-N or —] | ORD-NNN | [declarative statement carrying the value] | Must | [when live] | [BU, Function, Name] | [Department] | [how proven] | [CAP-NN or —] | [EPIC-NN or —] | |

---

## 9. Trade-offs, Risk, Assumptions and Dependencies

### 9.1 Accepted Trade-offs and Risks

Risks are owned by the RAID log — cite the `R-NNN` rather than duplicating the risk record.

| RAID Ref | Trade-off / Risk | Accepted? | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| [R-NNN or —] | [e.g. cost vs availability] | Yes / No | [Mitigation] |

### 9.2 Assumptions

Carries forward the assumptions table from `/idea`. `If false` is mandatory. On falsification set
`Status: Falsified`, run `/raid add risk`, and record the `R-NNN` in `If false`.

| ID | Assumption | Status | If false | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ASM-NNN | [declarative statement] | Unvalidated / Validated / Falsified | [consequence] | [role] |

### 9.3 Dependencies

| ID | Depends on | Type | Owner | Needed by | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEP-NNN | [named system, team, or deliverable] | Internal / External / Vendor | [role] | [date or milestone] | Open / Met / At risk |

## Appendices

### A. Acronyms and Abbreviations
### B. PRD Cross-Link

> *View. The register in §§3–8 is the source of truth — `BRD#` and `Source` already live in each
> row, so they are not restated here.*

This appendix exists only for the one link the register cannot hold: the sibling PRD. Omit it
entirely for a standalone ORD. It is populated by `/write-reqs`, which owns the cross-link pass.

| ORD# | Section | PRD# |
|---|---|---|
| ORD-001 | [e.g. 3.2.1] | [PRD-NNN] |

Flag rather than resolve, against the register itself:
- A row with `BRD#` = `—` **and** no `Source` is **orphan scope**.
- A BRD requirement with no resulting register row is a **coverage gap**.
- `ASM-NNN` and `DEP-NNN` are not requirements and never appear here — they live in §9.

### E. Interface Detail

Per-interface technical detail, keyed to the §3.4.1 register rows. Specification, not commitment —
the binding statement is the register row.

| ORD# | Integrated System | Interface Type | Protocol | Data Exchanged | Direction | Failure Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ORD-NNN | [System name] | [REST/SFTP/etc.] | [HTTPS/SFTP/etc.] | [Description] | [In/Out/Bidirectional] | [Queue / alert / degrade] |

### C. Contacts
### D. Change History
