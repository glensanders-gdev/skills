# Requirements Rules

Authoring standards for requirements documents — how a requirement is *worded* and how it is
*presented*. Consumed by `/write-brd`, `/write-prd`, `/write-ord`, `/write-reqs`, and `/write-ac`.

```
standards/requirements/
├── README.md      ← this file
├── language.md    ← voice and tone, sentences and word choice, numbers and dates, citing sources, modality, banned constructions
├── tables.md      ← table-first presentation, document structure, reference list, canonical schemas, ID namespaces
├── ai.md          ← conditional: learned or generated behaviour (see trigger test)
├── reporting.md   ← conditional: a measure that is reported (see trigger test)
└── llm-companion.md ← the machine-readable companion /write-brd and /write-ord write beside the document
```

`language.md` and `tables.md` are unconditional — every requirements document obeys both.

`ai.md` and `reporting.md` are **conditional**: each applies on top of the unconditional two, and
neither relaxes either. They are independent — a change can fire both, one, or neither.

| File | Fires when | Adds |
|---|---|---|
| `ai.md` | a delivered component's behaviour is learned or generated rather than specified | the evaluative criterion, `EVL-NNN` / `MDL-NNN`, the ISO/IEC 25059 class map |
| `reporting.md` | the change creates, alters or retires a measure somebody reports | the measure definition, `DAT-NNN`, the ISO/IEC 25012 data-quality anchor |

`llm-companion.md` governs no requirement. It defines the `.llm.md` view `/write-brd` and
`/write-ord` generate from the saved document for a language model to consume — a view that adds,
drops and rewords nothing, and is never the reviewed artefact.

See ADR-0003 for why AI requirements extend the pack rather than forming a fourth document;
`reporting.md` follows the same precedent rather than adding a reporting document.

## Why this lives in `standards/`, not `rules/`

`rules/common/` is the always-applied baseline for **code**. `rules/[lang]/` is activated
per-project via `/lang-rules`. Neither fits: these rules govern **documents**, and they apply
whenever a requirements document is authored regardless of the project's language or whether
any code exists yet.

This ruleset is not auto-loaded. The requirement skills cite it by path, per PRINCIPLE 6
(reference, don't duplicate). It exists so the sibling documents share one definition of a
requirement's form — neither `/write-prd` nor `/write-ord` can own it without the other
drifting, and `/write-reqs` is barred from owning templates.

It cannot sit under `rules/`. Claude Code and VS Code load every file under
`~/.claude/rules/` without `paths:` frontmatter into every session, so a ruleset kept there is
paid for in every session whether or not a requirements document is in play. Neither loads
`~/.claude/standards/`. A path-scoped pointer in `~/.claude/rules/`, named `requirements`, covers
the gap: it loads only when a session reads a document under `docs/brd/`, `docs/prd/`, `docs/ord/`
or `docs/ac/`, and names these files, so a requirements document edited outside a skill still
meets them.

## Scope boundary — read this first

These rules govern **generated document content only**.

They do **not** apply to the skills' own instruction prose. A skill instruction such as
"at least one KPP must be identified" is correct and stays. Applying the language rules to the
skill files themselves would strip the directives that make the skills work.

| Text | Governed? |
|---|---|
| A requirement, criterion, assumption or commitment written into a PRD/ORD/AC document | Yes |
| A skill's instructions to Claude, its rules, its failure-mode table | No |
| Template placeholder text and worked examples inside a template | Yes — examples teach the form |
| Narrative context sections (background, mission, operational scenarios) | Partially — see `language.md` § Narrative sections |

`ai.md` adds one boundary of its own: it governs AI as the **subject** of a requirement. AI as the
**author** of the solution is `ai-first-engineering`, which is not a requirements ruleset and is not
governed here.

## Enforcement

`/review-language` checks a document against `language.md`, and `/review-ord` and `/review-brd`
run it as an advisory pass after the gate. It reports findings and never changes a gate verdict.
`/review-language --skill <name>` checks the governed text inside a skill — its templates and
worked examples — and leaves its instructions out, per the table above.

`/check-style` reads `~/.claude/knowledge/company/style-guide.md`, not this ruleset — a company
style guide may add to these rules but never relaxes them. Where the two conflict, the stricter
requirement wins and the conflict is flagged rather than silently resolved.

**One exception: locale.** A company style guide's `Locale` section *replaces* the Australian
defaults in `language.md` § *Locale Conventions* (spelling, dictionary, prose dates, times,
financial year). Replacing them is not a relaxation, so the stricter-wins rule does not apply to
them. With no `Locale` section, or an incomplete one, the Australian defaults stay in force.
