# Skills

65 skills for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — practical, self-contained
workflows for getting real work done with an AI assistant.

They cover the parts of software delivery that benefit most from structure: writing
requirements, stress-testing a plan before you build it, test-driven implementation,
code and security review, accessibility, and keeping context under control across
long sessions. Each one stands on its own — install the whole set or a single skill.

## Install

Everything:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/glensanders-gdev/skills.git && cd skills && ./install.sh
```

Or a single skill — copy the folder into `~/.claude/skills/`:

```bash
cp -r skills/tdd ~/.claude/skills/
```

Restart your session, then invoke a skill by name — `/tdd`, `/review-diff`, `/write-prd`.

Some skills cite the shared standards in `rules/`. `install.sh` copies those to
`~/.claude/rules/` alongside the skills.

## Conventions

Every skill declares its execution mode — **[HITL]** pauses for a human, **[AFK]** runs
through. Anything consequential asks for a typed confirmation (`CONFIRM`, `APPROVE`,
`GO`). Every skill also carries explicit "never" rules, not just instructions.
